# Federation

Framework is built on a federated architecture, which means that it is made up of multiple servers that communicate with each other. This enables us to scale our platform to vast sizes, maintains our three core values of security, privacy, and freedom, and allows us to provide a better experience for our users.

## What is federation?

Federation in the software world is a way of distributing a single application across multiple servers which all adhere to the same standard of operations in a manner to facilitate communication between them.

The most common example of federation is the internet, where you have a single application (the internet) that is distributed across multiple servers (the internet service providers). The internet service providers all adhere to the same standard of operations (TCP/IP) in a manner to facilitate communication between them (routing packets).

In simpler terms, federation is a collective that all implement similar protocols to be interoperable with each other. Examples of federation in the software world include:

- [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), a federated social network
- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), a federated chat protocol
- [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), a federated social networking protocol

# Contributing to the project

We welcome contributions from everyone, and we encourage users to open an issue if they have any questions or suggestions, or create a pull request if they have something nice to contribute.

We are mainly interested in issues and pull requests that address bugs, or new features. This doesn't mean that we will not review your pull request, it just means we have a higher priority to sort them out first.

## Guidelines for contributing

### Code

- Your code must be clean and linted before it is merged. We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce this.
- Do not add any unnecessary dependencies. Try to keep your dependencies to the minimum.
- Try not to push commits that result in failing builds or tests.
- Do not add any unnecessary files, like for example, random text files with no purpose to the project.

### Working with other contributors

We are **__all people__**. We are not a corporation, and we do not have a formal structure. We are a community of people who are passionate about open source and passionate about building a fun experience for everyone, around the world.

This project is developed by people on their own time. So, please, be considerate of the feelings of other members of the community.

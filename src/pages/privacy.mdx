};

## Preface

This privacy policy is applicable to the [Framework](https://framework.soodam.rocks) website and all services provided by Soodam.re.
This policy is subject to change at any time, and you should check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.
You'll also be notified through Framework's notification system of changes to any of our policies, and will typically allow
you to opt-out of any changes.

In this policy, we refer to the website and all services provided by Soodam.re as "Framework" or "we". We refer to the user as "you", "your", or "user".

## TL;DR

We highly recommend you read the entire policy, but here's a quick summary of your privacy rights and our obligations to you:

- Personal info
  - We do not illicitly collect any personal information about you, most information we have on you waas provided voluntary and done so at your own discretion,
    through the use of our services.
  - We do not sell your personal information to third parties, nor do we share it with any third parties. We also do not implement
    any tracking or analytical mechanisms that could jeopardize your privacy and anonymity on the Internet.
  - We do not store your personal information for longer than necessary, and we do not store any sensitive information about you. Upon
    your request, we will delete all personal information we have about you. ([General Data Protection Regulation, Article 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/))
- Cookies
  - We use cookies for the sole purpose of maintaining your session on Framework.
- Analytics
  - We do not implement any analytics or tracking mechanisms on Framework, as mentioned above.
- Data Safety
  - We take all reasonable measures to ensure that your data is safe and secure, including:
    - Ensuring our SSL ([Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)) certificate is up-to-date and valid.
      SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides communication security over the Internet.
    - Frequently auditing our codebase for security vulnerabilities, and patching them as soon as they are discovered.
      - Framework is free ([Richard Stallman definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)) and open-source software, and is
        available for anyone to audit and contribute to. Open source software is typically more secure than proprietary software,
        as it is more transparent and allows for more scrutiny from the community.
    - Regularly backing up our data to ensure that we can recover sensitive information in the event of a loss.
- Data Breaches
  - We will notify you of any data breaches that affect your personal information, and will provide you with instructions on how to
    mitigate the damage. ([General Data Protection Regulation, Article 33](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/))
    - We will also notify the relevant authorities of any data breaches that affect your personal information, and will provide them
      with instructions on how to mitigate the damage. For more information, see the [Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted).

  - We have many channels of communication available to you:
    - [Discord](https://discord.gg/g88JS6Tmte)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/Tsodinq/framework) _File an issue_

## 1. Personal Information

### 1.1 What is personal information?

"Personal information", as defined by the [European Union's General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/), is any information
that can be used to identify you, directly or indirectly. An non-exhaustive list of examples of personal information includes:

- Your full name ¹
- Your email address ¹
- Your IP address ¹
- Your location ¹
- Your phone number ¹
- ...and more

> **¹** Sources:
>
> - [GDPR Art 4.1](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)
> - [Dutch Data Protection Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/2021-01-01)

### 1.2 What personal information do we collect?

We do not collect any personal information about you, except for a select few instances listed below, unless you provide it to us
voluntarily, through forms on our website, etc. An example of this would be when you sign up for an account on Framework,
or when you contact us through our contact form. You provide us with this information at your own discretion.

Information we collect about you without direct interaction from you includes:

- Your IP address
  - We collect your IP address when you visit our website, and when you use our services. We use this information to prevent
    malicious activity on our website, and to prevent abuse of our services (e.g. DDoS, spam, etc.).
    - Your IP address is only associated with login sessions. Once you log out of Framework,
      the session and all it's data is deleted, including your IP address.
- Your browser's user agent
  - Your [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) is a string of information
    that your browser sends to websites you visit. This information includes your browser's name and version, your operating
    system's name and version, and more. We use this to enhance your experience on Framework, and to help us identify
    underlying issues that may be dependent on your browser or operating system.

#### GDPR Compliance Clarification

Framework is not a data controller, and does not collect any personal information about you. We are a data processor, and we process
your personal information on behalf of you, the data controller.

### 1.3 How do we use your personal information?

We do not use your personal information in shady ways. We only use your personal information to provide you with the services you
requested, and to improve our services. We do not sell or distribute any of your account information to third parties.

Our goal as a platform is to provide you with a safe, free, and generally pleasant experience playing games in our community.
We do not use your personal information to target you with advertisements, nor do we use it to track your activity on the Internet.

We hope that other services will follow the standards we set, and that we can help set a precedent for how to treat your personal
information on the Internet. Privacy is literally, a [human right](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). We
believe that corporations should not be able to exploit your personal information for profit, and that you should be able to
control your own data in its entirety.

### 1.4 How do we store your personal information?

Your data is stored in the Netherlands, on servers we ourselves own and operate. Due to this, we are subject to the
[Dutch Data Protection Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/2021-01-01), [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/),
and other relevant European Union laws.

Data transmitted between your browser and our services is, by industry standards, encrypted using [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).
Once your data reaches our servers, "sensitive" data is encrypted using [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
meaning that it is remotely impossible for anyone to illegally access your data.

## 2 Exemptions

### 2.1 I'm not in the European Union, do I still have rights?

Yes. The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) applies to services that base their operations in the European
Union, or that target users in the European Union. Framework is based in the Netherlands, and targets users in the European Union,
therefore we are subject to the GDPR, and you're entitled to those rights.

### 2.2 I'm under 13, do I have rights?

You're not allowed to use Framework if you're under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13,
and we do not target our services towards children under 13.

> If you're using Framework between the ages of 13 and 16, you must have your parent or guardian's permission to use Framework.
>
> - [GDPR Art 8.1](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-8-gdpr/) (E.U.)
> - [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule) (U.S.)

### 2.3 I'm not a human, do I have rights?

Yes. The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) applies to all "natural persons", which includes humans, but
also animals, plants, and other living organisms. We do not knowingly collect personal information from non-humans, and we hopefully
don't directly target our services towards non-humans.

## Ending Notes

We hope that you enjoy using Framework, and that you feel safe and secure using our services. We will do everything we can to
protect your liberty as a human being, and to protect your sovereignty over your own data.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please contact us through one of the channels listed above.

## Free Speech

Soodam.re and our affiliates are committed to free speech. We have a set of standards that we expect our users to follow,
We implement a non-biased approach to moderation, and we do not censor content unless it violates our Guidelines, you're reading now.

Our exemptions to free speech are limited, as listed below:

- **Hate Speech:** We do not tolerate hate speech of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and other forms of bigotry.
- **Malicious Content:** We do not tolerate malicious content of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, threats of violence, doxxing, and other forms of harassment.
- **Spam:** We do not tolerate spam of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, advertising, phishing, and other forms of spam, as well as content that may harm our platform.
- **NSFW/Nudity:** Nude or otherwise 'not safe for work' content is not allowed on Framework.

You see? We are very lenient with our rules, and we never censor content unless it violates our guidelines.

## Swearing?

Swearing is permitted on Framework, as long as it is not used to harass or bully others at extreme levels.

## NSFW Content

NSFW content is not allowed on Framework. This includes, but is not limited to, nudity, pornography, depictions of real-world atrocities, and other forms of NSFW content.

## Harassment

Harassment is not allowed on Framework. On this platform, you're expected to be respectful to others and be civil. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, including threats of violence (e.g. doxxing, swatting, 'I'll find you and kill your whole family'), and other forms of harassment.

## Spam

Please do not spam on Framework.

---

We reserve the right to change these guidelines at any time, and we reserve the right to remove any content that violates our guidelines.

We have a very lenient set of rules. It's incredibly simply summarized as "be respectful to others and be civil". If you
have any questions, please contact us at `guidelines@soodam.rocks` and we'll happily answer them.

As a member of Framework, you agree to follow these guidelines to ensure a positive and welcoming environment for all members.

## Prohibited Conduct

The following conduct is strictly prohibited:

- Harassment or bullying of any kind, including targeted harassment and incitement of others to engage in harassing behavior
- Any illegal activities, such as sharing copyrighted material or engaging in fraud
- Spamming the community with unnecessary or irrelevant content, or sharing false or misleading information
- Posting personal information without consent
- Any conduct that is deemed inappropriate or offensive, including the use of inappropriate or offensive language or content

## Freedom of Speech

Framework values the free exchange of ideas and opinions, and as such, we allow a wide range of speech within the community. However, freedom of speech is not absolute, and we reserve the right to enforce the guidelines outlined above and remove content that violates these guidelines or is otherwise deemed inappropriate.

In addition, we ask that all members be respectful of others' right to express their opinions and beliefs, even if you disagree with them. Personal attacks and harassment are not protected under the umbrella of freedom of speech, and will not be tolerated.

By participating in this community, you agree to respect the freedom of speech of others and to refrain from engaging in any conduct that would interfere with or inhibit the free expression of others.

## Additional Guidelines

In addition to the above, you should also:

- Respect others and their personal characteristics, such as race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation
- Follow all rules and guidelines set forth by Soodam.re's staff and each instances administrators apart of the Fediverse
- Keep your content appropriate for all ages, and use appropriate content warnings when necessary to properly warn others of potentially sensitive content
- Be considerate of others and their feelings, and try to resolve conflicts peacefully

## Enforcement

Violations of these guidelines may result in disciplinary action, up to and including the revocation of your membership in the community
in the form of an account suspension, IP ban, or hardware-level ban. If you are found to be in violation of these guidelines, you may be
contacted by the community administrators to discuss the situation and determine an appropriate course of action.

## Changes to the Guidelines

These guidelines may be amended from time to time at the discretion of Soodam.re. It is your responsibility to stay informed of any changes to the guidelines.

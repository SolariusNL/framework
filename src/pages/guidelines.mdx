## User-generated Content
We have some fairly basic rules for user-generated content:

- **No NSFW content**: NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content is not allowed. This includes:
  - Porn in any type
  - Death
  - Real-world atrocities
  - etc.
- **No malicious content**: Malicious content is not permitted on Framework:
  - Malware
  - Content targetted towards a person or a group of people
  - Threats to the public
  - etc.
- **Respect others**: Respect others' rights. Avoid doing these:
  - Impersonation
  - Violating copyright
  - etc.
- **No spam**: Spam is not allowed. This includes:
  - Advertising (outside of Framework)
  - Promotional content (outside of Framework)
  - etc.

## Use of Profanity
Although profanity is not strictly prohibited on Framework, we prefer that you use language that is more appropriate for the community.

## Exploiting
Exploiting our services is strictly forbidden. We implement various measures throughout our services to prevent this, but we cannot guarantee that these measures will prevent all exploitation methods.

If we find that you are utilizing tools or techniques to exploit Framework, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, removing your account, blocking your IP address, and/or blocking your unique hardware identifier.

## Respecting Others
We value the freedom of others, therefore we do not tolerate harassment of others. Please for the love of all that is good, just be respectful of others. We have a strict policy for harassment, and we will take appropriate action if you're found to be harassing others.

Avoid using the following:
- Discriminatory language or exclusionary behavior
- Intimidating behavior intended to cause fear or panic
- Threats to other users (e.g. "I will fucking kill you the second I see you bitch")

It's not hard to filter yourself and move on with your day.

## Disclaimer
Framework staff are permitted to punish users at their own discretion, that may not fall within these guidelines.

Use basic common sense. Think before you hit send. Do you really need to say that? What would other people think of this?

We have a very loose set of rules. It's an open platform after all. Just be kind! :^)

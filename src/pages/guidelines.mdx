## Free Speech

Soodam.re and our affiliates are committed to free speech and open discussion. We don't censor or ban people for their opinions, but we do reserve the right to remove content that is hateful, threatening, or otherwise violates these guidelines.

We try not to be the arbiter of what is and isn't offensive, what is a 'joke' or not. Sometimes, we need to make a judgement call, and we will do so in good faith. We implement various tools and policies to prevent biased moderation and
will always err on the side of free speech.

These guidelines are not exhaustive, and we reserve the right to remove any content that we deem to be in bad faith or otherwise harmful to the community.

### No Hate Speech

We do not tolerate hate speech, and we will remove any content that is hateful or discriminatory. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Racial slurs or other discriminatory language targeting a specific (or groups of) people
- Sexist, homophobic, or transphobic language
- Content that promotes or encourages violence against a specific group of people
- Content that promotes or encourages violence against an individual
- ...and more

We take hate speech very seriously, and we will ban users who repeatedly violate this rule. Peace and love throughout the community is what enables true innovation and creativity.

### No Threats of Violence

Violent threats are not allowed on Framework. Threatening to incite, promote, conspire, or commit violence against an individual or group of people is not allowed. Some examples of this include:

- "Doxxing" (publishing private information about an individual or group of people) - 'joke' or not
- Threatening to commit violence against an individual or group of people (goes along with hate speech)
- Threatening to commit atrocities (mass shootings, bombings, etc.)
- Repeatedly posting violent content (graphic images, videos, etc.)

It is not hard to be civil and respectful to others. If you can't do such a simple thing, please leave the community and save yourself the trouble.

### No Spam

Spam is not allowed on Framework. Spam is defined as any content that is posted repeatedly in an attempt to gain attention or promote a product or service. Some examples of this include:

- Posting the same content repeatedly in different 'channels'
- Posting repetetive content that serves no purpose other than to gain attention

'Spam' is a very broad term, and we reserve the right to remove any content that we deem to be spam. If you are unsure whether or not your content is spam, it probably is.

### No NSFW Content

NSFW (not safe for work) is prohibited on Framework. Please do not discuss or upload content that is pornographic, sexually explicit, includes nudity, or is otherwise inappropriate for a work environment.

### No Illegal Activity

Framework is not a place to discuss or promote illegal activity. This includes the use/possession of illegal drugs, firearms, or otherwise 'illegal' items.

## Enforcement

We take these guidelines very seriously, and we will enforce them to the best of our ability. If you see someone violating these guidelines, please report them to us. We will investigate and take appropriate action.

If you are found to be in violation of these guidelines, your account may receive a warning or be permanently banned. There is no in-between.

Appeals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and we reserve the right to deny any appeal. If you are banned, creating new accounts to circumvent the ban is not allowed. If you repeatedly create accounts to violate these guidelines, you may
receive a hardware-ID or IP ban.

## That's about it

We hope you find a renewed sense of community on Framework. We are here to help you, and we are here to help each other. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us at `guidelines@soodam.rocks` and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

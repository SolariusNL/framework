### 5. Your Content

Framework allows you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through Framework, you give Soodam.re (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with Framework), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving Framework, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using Framework (for example, for a business listing you have added to Framework). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to Framework.

We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your content. We do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any content.

### 6. Your Conduct

You are responsible for your conduct and any data, text, files, information, usernames, images, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, links and other content or materials (collectively, "Content") that you submit, post, and display on Framework.

Soodam.re reserves the right to hold you liable in the Court of Law for any illegal or unauthorized use of Framework. You agree not to use Framework to upload, post, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through or on Framework any of the following:

- Content that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene
- Content that is harmful to minors in any way
- Content that harasses or advocates harassment of another person
- Content that exploits people in a sexual or violent manner

### 7. Reporting Abuse

If you believe that someone has violated the Terms or otherwise created liability for us, use the built-in reporting system to report abuse. We will investigate and take appropriate action, which may include removing or disabling access to content, accounts, and devices.

### 8. Punishment for Abuse

We may take any action with respect to user content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such content violates the Terms, including the content standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of Framework or the public or could create liability for us.

### 9. Framework Content

Framework may contain content that is owned by us or our licensors. This content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and is owned or controlled by us or our licensors. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, display, perform, modify, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit, any of the content, in whole or in part.

You may not use any content from Framework unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in Framework. Do not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with Framework.

### 10. Framework Features

Framework may offer you features that may allow you to share your content with the public. Please think carefully about what you are making public.

### 11. Framework Premium

Framework Premium is a paid subscription service that provides additional features and functionality to Framework. Framework Premium is available to users who are 18 years of age or older. Framework Premium is not available to users who have been suspended or removed from Framework.

### 12. Framework Premium Subscription

Framework Premium is a subscription service. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (depending on the type of subscription plan you select) ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a subscription to Framework Premium. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Framework Premium subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Framework cancels it. You may cancel your subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Framework customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Framework Premium subscription. You shall provide Framework with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Framework to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Framework will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

### 13. Framework Premium Free Trial

Framework may, at its sole discretion, offer a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Framework until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fees for the type of Framework Premium subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, Framework reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

### 14. Framework Premium Cancellation

You may cancel your Framework Premium subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. You will not receive a refund for any of the subscription fees that you have already paid.

### 15. Framework Premium Refunds

All fees paid are non-refundable.

### 16. Framework Premium Price Changes

Framework, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees for the Framework Premium subscription. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Framework will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of Framework Premium after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.
